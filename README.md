```

```bash
cd MathQuest
```

- **Or using SSH:**
  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nukri-tskvitaia/MathQuest.git
```

```bash
cd MathQuest
```

**2. Set up the database:**
- Ensure that SQL Server is running.
- Update the connection string in ***appsettings.Development.json*** file (Located in __MathQuest.Server project__)
- Modify the __AttachDbFilename__ property in your connection string to point to the absolute path of the __MathQuest.mdf__ file.
- Your connection string should look something like this:

```json
AttachDbFilename=\\absolute_path_to_your_project\\mathquest-project\\Data\\DB\\MathQuest.mdf
```

- Ensure that you have `dotnet-ef` installed by running this command in a Command Prompt or Terminal:

```bash
dotnet ef --version
```

You should see any such version 8.0.x. If not then install it using:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 8.0.0
```
(or any such version 8.0.x For example, --version 8.0.6)
  
- Create a new migration and apply it:
Make sure you are in this directory... ***absolute_path_to_your_folder/Mathquest/Data*** from there you can run the following commands:

  ```bash
  dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --output-dir Migrations --startup-project ../MathQuest/MathQuest.Server
  ```

  ```bash
  dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../MathQuest/MathQuest.Server
  ```

**3. Configure JWT Tokens:**
- To set up JWT authentication, simply enter your JWT key in the configuration below, and youâ€™re all set!

```json
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "enter_your_jwt_key_here",
    "Issuer": "https://localhost:5001",
    "Audience": "https://localhost:5100",
    "AccessTokenExpirationMinutes": 30,
    "RefreshTokenExpirationDays": 7,
    "RequireHttpsMetadata": true,
    "SaveToken": false,
    "ValidateIssuer": true,
    "ValidateAudience": true,
    "ValidateLifetime": true,
    "ValidateIssuerSigningKey": true
  }
```

Replace "enter_your_jwt_key_here" with your actual JWT key.

**4. Google Authentication:**
Currently, Google authentication is not implemented. To enable Google authentication, follow these steps:
You need to configure your Google authentication settings in the `User Secrets` of the `MathQuest.Server` project. Add the following configuration to your `User Secrets`:

```json
   {
     "Google:ClientId": "your client id",
     "Google:ClientSecret": "your client secret"
   }
```

The __MathQuest.Server__ project is already set up to use Google authentication. You can verify this in the Startup.cs file. The relevant code snippet is:
```csharp services.AddAuthentication()
        .AddGoogle(opts =>
        {
            opts.ClientId = Configuration["Google:ClientId"];
            opts.ClientSecret = Configuration["Google:ClientSecret"];
        });```

Make any additional changes as needed to integrate Google authentication into the application fully.

If you choose not to use Google authentication, you can disable it by commenting out or removing the Google authentication setup code.
In your Startup.cs file, comment out or delete the following lines:
```csharp
services.AddAuthentication()
        .AddGoogle(opts =>
        {
            opts.ClientId = Configuration["Google:ClientId"];
            opts.ClientSecret = Configuration["Google:ClientSecret"];
        });
```

**5. Email Service:**
5.1. **Setup SMTP**
If you wish to use the email service rather than the console for sending emails, replace the placeholder values in the configuration below with your actual SMTP server details.

```json
"Mail": {
  "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "SmtpPort": 465,
  "SmtpUsername": "your_smtp_username",
  "SmtpPassword": "your_smtp_password",
  "SenderName": "your_sender_name",
  "SenderEmail": "your_sender_email",
